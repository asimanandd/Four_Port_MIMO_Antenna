# DISCRIPTION


This work was concerned with the design, simulation, and analysis of an optimized Four-Port MIMO antenna for 5G use, in the 3-5 GHz band. The methodical process of design, starting with a single-port, moving on to a two-port setup, and culminating in the four-port MIMO design, showed considerable enhancements in isolation, gain, as well as radiation performance. The chosen FR4 Epoxy substrate, optimal antenna geometry, and microstrip feeding method added to improved performance through reduced mutual coupling effects and enhanced
impedance matching. The S-parameter data indicated that Port 2 and Port 4 resonate around 3.5 GHz, and Port 1 and Port 3 slightly 3.8 GHz, probably caused by coupling interactions. This indicates that optimizing the placement of elements further can improve resonance uniformity. The plots of directivity exhibited a properly formed radiation pattern with expected broadside features, a signature of microstrip patch antennas. Besides that, the pattern of gain further established maximum radiation at the edge of the patch, as it should be based on theory. Radiation efficiency and field distributions authenticated the performance capability of the antenna within the wanted frequency band. The comparative study of the two-port and four-port MIMO antennas showed that the four-port implementation enhanced spatial diversity and data rates at
the cost of some reasonable isolation levels. Nevertheless, some degradation in isolation occurred, especially at higher frequencies, which was an indication that sophisticated isolation methods, such as electromagnetic bandgap structures or decoupling networks, could be used to further improve performance.
